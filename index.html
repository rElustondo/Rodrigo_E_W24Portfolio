                <p>Dear Human Resources,<br>
                    I am writing to express my interest in the Example Job position at Example Company, that came to me through an email notifying me that I have been referred. With a strong background in computer programming and teamwork, I am confident in my ability to contribute effectively to your team and uphold the values that matter to your organization.
                </p>
                <p>Throughout my career, I have honed my communication and interpersonal skills by completing certifications at UofT such as Business Communications, working alongside coworkers and talking to clients to better improve the services I provided. These experiences have required me to exercise tact, diplomacy, and discretion, allowing me to effectively engage with diverse individuals in various situations.
                </p>
                <p>I possess strong initiative and self-managing skills, demonstrated by my ability to work independently with minimal direction. For example in my previous role at UBILD technologies, I successfully navigated challenges, responded proactively to issues, and consistently delivered results while maintaining a high level of autonomy.
                </p>
                <p>My advanced technical skills in software packages such as Microsoft Word, Power Point, Excel, and Outlook align seamlessly with the requirements of the Early Talent Programs & Strategy position.
                </p>
                <p>I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills and enthusiasm to Example Company, and I look forward to the possibility of discussing how my experiences align with the needs of the position. Thank you for considering my application.
